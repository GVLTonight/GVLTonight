Now with their first full-length effort Ghosts Are Calling Out, produced by Ben Ellman (a member of the funk/rock act Galactic) and mixed by Mikael “Count” Eldridge (a producer/engineer whose past work includes releases by Radiohead, the Rolling Stones, and a Grammy Award-winning effort from Mavis Staples), the Charleston-based band expands their sound by pursuing their passion for loose and joyful experimentation.\n\nWorking with a treasure trove of obscure and vintage lo-fi gear, Dead 27s have widened their sonic repertoire to offer up an album that’s boldly inventive but rooted in pure emotion. The follow-up to 2014’s Chase Your Devils Down—an EP praised by the likes of No Depression, who remarked that “you can feel their music in your bones”—Ghosts Are Calling Out builds off its predecessor’s earthy sensibility and gritty spirit. But while Dead 27s maintain their soulful melodicism and knack for heavy grooves, the new album finds the band crafting gorgeously warped textures that take their music in a thrilling new direction. “Making this album, we wanted to push ourselves and bring much more attention to detail to the production—and at the same time have some fun with all these weird, distorted sounds and tones that we were coming up with,” notes Mullinax.\n\nAfter releasing Chase Your Devils Down in spring 2014, Dead 27s earned the Charleston City Paper Music Awards’ Song of the Year prize two years in a row, ranked in the top 24 of VH1’s “Make a Band Famous” competition, and opened for such artists as Earphunk, Galactic, The Revivalists, Marcus King Band, and Tab Benoit. Fast gaining a reputation as an incendiary live act, the band devoted much of 2015 to touring as well as writing and pre-producing material for Ghosts Are Calling Out. With each show serving as a breeding ground for creativity, Dead 27s mine much inspiration from their time on the road.  Through that near-constant writing and performing, Dead 27s have vastly strengthened their creative connection and pushed the boundaries of their musicianship. “We’ve always worked in a way where everyone adds their own flavors to the songs, but this album was much more of a collaborative effort,” says Evans. “Each one of us was more heavily engaged in the whole process, and we ended up trying new stuff that we’re all really excited about and that goes way beyond just having some good new songs to put out.\"\n\nFunk You\n\nHailing from the east side GA town of Augusta, FUNK YOU is an outgoing burst of energy that is continually climbing their way to the top of the music scene. This \"funk\" oriented outfit projects multiple musical styles focusing mainly on dance driven grooves with powerful clean vocals. Incorporating intriguing musical composition, tasteful lyrics, and crowd captivating live performances, FUNK YOU is surely to make an imprint on your musical taste.\n\nFUNK YOU provides the audience with a furious fusion of influences ranging from Umphrey's Mcgee, Lettuce, James brown, and Stevie Wonder. By colliding funk, jam, rock, fusion, and prog into one uniform sound, these guys will keep your jaw dropped and your feet moving without stopping. Their songs combine lush ambiance, catchy vocals, and intense shredding simultaneously into a unique well defined sound. \n\nFor three years the band has been building their fan base in the southern local markets of Atlanta, Augusta, Athens, Statesboro, Milledgeville, Savannah and Macon. They have numerous sold out shows in Augusta and also at the Georgia Theater in Athens. With performances alongside Maceo Parker & Fred Wesley (James Brown horn section), Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Tea Leaf Green, Robert Randolph, Snarky Puppy, and Moon Taxi, the band is paving their way to the festival circuit. FUNK YOU was voted best R&B band by August Magazine and was named Relix Magazine's \"Artist On the Rise\" in their July/August 2013 issue.\n\nPerseverance and hard work best describe the band's attitude, so if you haven't yet, you will be seeing them soon.","url":"https://facebook.com/111671332753606","time":"21:30:00-0400","date":"2017-06-23"},{"collection":"gottrocks","venue":"GOTTROCKS","venueUrl":"https://facebook.com/188656604439","title":"The Mantras w/ Dkat Funk Jam Allstars","description":"The Mantras w/ special guests: Dkat Funk Jam Allstars \n\nThursday, June 22\nGOTTROCKS\n200 Eisenhower Dr, Greenville, SC 29607\n\n$10 DOS\n\nwww.themantras.com\nthe-mantras.bandcamp.com","url":"https://facebook.com/652410671634415","time":"21:00:00-0400","date":"2017-06-22"},{"collection":"gottrocks","venue":"GOTTROCKS","venueUrl":"https://facebook.com/188656604439","title":"Matt Morgan & Friends","url":"https://facebook.com/1965866006976434","time":"21:00:00-0400","date":"2017-06-21"},{"collection":"gottrocks","venue":"GOTTROCKS","venueUrl":"https://facebook.com/188656604439","title":"Jam for Trevor with Marcus King Band, The Work and Family, and Friends","description":"Come celebrate life and sound with us at this benefit performance for Trevor McCurdy with The Marcus King Band, The Work and Family, with Special Guests Darby Wilcox, Kyle & Tyler from Four14, Jef Chandler, Dr. Luv Beatz at Gottrocks!\n\n$15 door donation, Raffles and more...\n\nTrevor is a local artist and beloved friend of Greenville's music scene.

We've got a special show in store for ya'll!!! \n\nTickets $5ADV/$8DOS\nTicket Link TBA Soon\nAges 21+\nAdditional Information:\n\nWhat’s in a name? Sometimes, everything… Grass is Dead are a bluegrass combo paying homage to the music and cultural legacy of The Grateful Dead, arguably America’s first folk rock band and one of the most influential musical artists of the last 50 years. The catalogue of the Dead’s music is a gold mine for string bands and story tellers, and Grass Is Dead have established themselves far and wide as premiere purveyors of this rich tradition of Americana music. Pickin’ and grinnin’ is what they do best, and they have been adapting Grateful Dead songs in their own bluegrass style since 1998.\n\nA festival favorite, Grass is Dead has built a loyal following from their home state of FL throughout the Eastern United States through burning live shows, and well beyond, through word of mouth, social media and old fashioned taper trees. The demand for Grateful Dead music is seemingly endless, and there are countless cover bands satisfying that demand on the local level, but there are not many artists out there approaching the music from the perspective of Grass is Dead. It is not complicated or artsy: this is a straight forward hootenanny built to last, and fans of either bluegrass music, The Grateful Dead, or both always leave happy, because sometimes there’s nothing left to do but  smile, smile, smile…","url":"https://facebook.com/152657498606245","time":"21:00:00-0400","date":"2017-06-14"},{"collection":"groundzero","venue":"GroundZero","venueUrl":"https://facebook.com/211975785235","title":"Tba","url":"https://facebook.com/795460383964057","time":"18:00:00-0400","date":"2017-10-22"},{"collection":"groundzero","venue":"GroundZero","venueUrl":"https://facebook.com/211975785235","title":"Tba Oct 19th","description":"Tba returns","url":"https://facebook.com/1333776686743423","time":"19:00:00-0400","date":"2017-10-19"},{"collection":"groundzero","venue":"GroundZero","venueUrl":"https://facebook.com/211975785235","title":"Tba Oct 18th","url":"https://facebook.com/104483370134434","time":"18:00:00-0400","date":"2017-10-18"},{"collection":"groundzero","venue":"GroundZero","venueUrl":"https://facebook.com/211975785235","title":"Communion of Darkness V - Black Metal Festival (2017)","description":"Negative Realm Booking & Promotion presents the 5th annual Communion of Darkness - Black Metal Festival!\n\nFriday Oct. 13th & Saturday Oct. 14th, 2017 at Ground Zero (Spartanburg, SC).\n\nFeaturing:\nSIVAD (TN)\nUnholy Black Metal from Memphis, TN.

Mac moved to Chicago and Muddy Waters hired him on the spot. He toured and recorded with the Muddy Waters Band and recorded LPs with Otis Spann and John Lee Hooker. Mac moved to Los Angeles and produced Soul Train with his friend Don Cornelius. He even played bass on the Sanford & Son television show when he wasn't playing bass for Otis Redding and B.B. King. He retired from show business to be an organic farmer. Mac is back with his own band and a \"plate full\" of CDs, building a new foundation in blues, soul and funk.\r\nMac Arnold must have known at an early age that his music career would read like a “Who’s who” of Blues/R&B Legends. His high school band “J Floyd & The Shamrocks” were often joined by none other than Macon, Georgia native, James Brown on piano. After deciding to pursue a professional music career, he joined the Charles Miller group until 1965 when he made the move to Chicago to work with recording artist/saxophonist A. C. Reed.\r\nIn late 1966, at age 24, came the opportunity of a lifetime to join the Muddy Waters Band and help shape the electric blues sound that inspired the rock and roll movement of the late 60’s and early 70’s. Regular guests of the band included Eric Clapton, Paul Butterfield, Mike Bloomfield, and Elvin Bishop. The Muddy Waters Band (as a unit) shared the stage with the likes of Howlin’ Wolfe, Elmore James, Jimmy Reed, Junior Wells, Big Joe Williams, and Big Mama Thornton just to name a few. During this time, Mac played on John Lee Hooker’s “live “album, Live at the Café Au Go-Go, as well as Otis Spann’s classic recording “The Blues is Where It’s At”.\r\nAfter more than a year with Muddy Waters, Mac formed the Soul Invaders which backed up many artists, including The Temptations and B. B. King. In the early 70’s, he moved Los Angeles to work at ABC Television and LAFF RECORDS (Redd Foxx). This led to working on the set of Soul Train from 1971 to 1975 and then working with Bill Withers (“Lean On Me”) before moving back to South Carolina in the 80”s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMac now resides in Pelzer, SC, where at the age of ten he got his first taste of the blues when he learned to play his brother Leroy’s home-made guitar. Going back to his roots. Mac is serving up a mess of Blues with his own band, “Mac Arnold & Plate Full O’ Blues”. The band consists Austin Brashier on guitar and vocals, Max Hightower on keyboards, harmonica, guitar, bass, and vocals, Tez Sherard on drums and vocals, and Mac Arnold on vocals, bass and Gas Can Guitars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMac & Muddy Waters\r\nIn 1965, having already established himself back home as a bass player, playing with J Floyd & the Shamrocks including James Brown on keyboard , Mac Arnold decided to take a trip to Chicago to check out the Blues scene. He was obviously impressed because 3 months later 24 year old Mac packed up and moved to the Windy City to expand his music career.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a club called the Green Bunny Club on 77 & Halstead St. where Mac first met his sax man A. C. Reed who at the time needed a bass player. Mac was the right man for the job. He played with A. C. for only a short time when he got a chance to play with Muddy Waters. He was asked to come out to Big John’s Grill on the North side to sit in with the band. Muddy asked him where he was from, he replied Greenville, South Carolina. Muddy said, “son, if you’re from the South, then you can play,” and so he did for over a year. His first gig with Muddy was the Mother Blues Club. The band’s line up was Luther Johnson on guitar, Sammy Lawhorn on guitar, Frances Clay on drums, Otis Spann on piano, Mac Arnold on bass, and Muddy on guitar and vocals. The band would play most of the show and Muddy would play the end of the set. On occasions he would play every other set. This gave the guys a chance to show their stuff. Mac had an edge because he’d been working with James Brown in the past. A lot of people had yet to of heard of James Brown, so when Mac would play that funky stuff, it got a lot of people’s attention. Mac is a left handed bass player, and if you listen to some of his early recordings, you will hear he was way ahead of his time.\r\nThe band would tour from the East to West Coast and all points in between. Cruisin’ in a 1965 Fleetwood Cadillac, all 7 band members and the driver (Bo) at the wheel. Bo could drive almost non-stop from St. Louis to San Francisco with no sleep. One time they were passing through Mississippi, they stopped in to see some of Muddy’s relatives and wound up doing a show. Mac stayed at Muddy’s cousin’s house, and when L. A. he would stay with George Smith and his family of 6 kids. While touring the West Coast, Mac fell in love with the California weather. When he returned to Chicago he told his wife “we’re moving.”\r\n​\r\nMac talked to Muddy and told him he would give him time to find another bass player. Muddy wished him luck and said “he would have him back any time,” and that was it. Mac is one of the last surviving members of the Muddy Water’s era, and so Mac Arnold & Plate Full O’ Blues begins.\r\n​","url":"https://facebook.com/444554215902026","time":"19:00:00-0400","date":"2017-06-30"},{"collection":"other","venue":"Sol Flowers of Anderson, SC","venueUrl":"https://facebook.com/1439597716066250","title":"First Annual Sunflower Solstice","description":"Come join us for the first annual Sol Flower Soiree!
