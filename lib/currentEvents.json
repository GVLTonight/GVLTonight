We can't wait to see our old friends in Greenville and debut the new BIG FIVE Lineup. We've got a special show in store for ya'll!!! \n\nTickets $5ADV/$8DOS\nTicket Link TBA Soon\nAges 21+\nAdditional Information:\n\nWhat’s in a name? Sometimes, everything… Grass is Dead are a bluegrass combo paying homage to the music and cultural legacy of The Grateful Dead, arguably America’s first folk rock band and one of the most influential musical artists of the last 50 years. The catalogue of the Dead’s music is a gold mine for string bands and story tellers, and Grass Is Dead have established themselves far and wide as premiere purveyors of this rich tradition of Americana music. Pickin’ and grinnin’ is what they do best, and they have been adapting Grateful Dead songs in their own bluegrass style since 1998.\n\nA festival favorite, Grass is Dead has built a loyal following from their home state of FL throughout the Eastern United States through burning live shows, and well beyond, through word of mouth, social media and old fashioned taper trees. The demand for Grateful Dead music is seemingly endless, and there are countless cover bands satisfying that demand on the local level, but there are not many artists out there approaching the music from the perspective of Grass is Dead. It is not complicated or artsy: this is a straight forward hootenanny built to last, and fans of either bluegrass music, The Grateful Dead, or both always leave happy, because sometimes there’s nothing left to do but  smile, smile, smile…","url":"https://facebook.com/152657498606245","time":"21:00:00-0400","date":"2017-06-14"},{"venue":"GOTTROCKS","venueUrl":"https://facebook.com/188656604439","title":"Roxy Roca LIVE from Greenville","url":"https://facebook.com/430785523961904","time":"21:00:00-0400","date":"2017-06-10"},{"venue":"GOTTROCKS","venueUrl":"https://facebook.com/188656604439","title":"Dave Jordan & The NIA Return to Greenville","description":"New Orleans based, roots rockers Dave Jordan and The Neighborhood Improvement Association are coming back to Gottrocks for a wild night of rock-your-face off & party down music, Nola style.","url":"https://facebook.com/1278873332161557","time":"20:00:00-0400","date":"2017-06-09"},{"venue":"GOTTROCKS","venueUrl":"https://facebook.com/188656604439","title":"Tranquility Lane Release  @ Gottrocks","description":"This metal/rock show is free so ignore the ticket link.

Mac moved to Chicago and Muddy Waters hired him on the spot. He toured and recorded with the Muddy Waters Band and recorded LPs with Otis Spann and John Lee Hooker. Mac moved to Los Angeles and produced Soul Train with his friend Don Cornelius. He even played bass on the Sanford & Son television show when he wasn't playing bass for Otis Redding and B.B. King. He retired from show business to be an organic farmer. Mac is back with his own band and a \"plate full\" of CDs, building a new foundation in blues, soul and funk.\r\nMac Arnold must have known at an early age that his music career would read like a “Who’s who” of Blues/R&B Legends. His high school band “J Floyd & The Shamrocks” were often joined by none other than Macon, Georgia native, James Brown on piano. After deciding to pursue a professional music career, he joined the Charles Miller group until 1965 when he made the move to Chicago to work with recording artist/saxophonist A. C. Reed.\r\nIn late 1966, at age 24, came the opportunity of a lifetime to join the Muddy Waters Band and help shape the electric blues sound that inspired the rock and roll movement of the late 60’s and early 70’s. Regular guests of the band included Eric Clapton, Paul Butterfield, Mike Bloomfield, and Elvin Bishop. The Muddy Waters Band (as a unit) shared the stage with the likes of Howlin’ Wolfe, Elmore James, Jimmy Reed, Junior Wells, Big Joe Williams, and Big Mama Thornton just to name a few. During this time, Mac played on John Lee Hooker’s “live “album, Live at the Café Au Go-Go, as well as Otis Spann’s classic recording “The Blues is Where It’s At”.\r\nAfter more than a year with Muddy Waters, Mac formed the Soul Invaders which backed up many artists, including The Temptations and B. B. King. In the early 70’s, he moved Los Angeles to work at ABC Television and LAFF RECORDS (Redd Foxx). This led to working on the set of Soul Train from 1971 to 1975 and then working with Bill Withers (“Lean On Me”) before moving back to South Carolina in the 80”s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMac now resides in Pelzer, SC, where at the age of ten he got his first taste of the blues when he learned to play his brother Leroy’s home-made guitar. Going back to his roots. Mac is serving up a mess of Blues with his own band, “Mac Arnold & Plate Full O’ Blues”. The band consists Austin Brashier on guitar and vocals, Max Hightower on keyboards, harmonica, guitar, bass, and vocals, Tez Sherard on drums and vocals, and Mac Arnold on vocals, bass and Gas Can Guitars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMac & Muddy Waters\r\nIn 1965, having already established himself back home as a bass player, playing with J Floyd & the Shamrocks including James Brown on keyboard , Mac Arnold decided to take a trip to Chicago to check out the Blues scene. He was obviously impressed because 3 months later 24 year old Mac packed up and moved to the Windy City to expand his music career.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a club called the Green Bunny Club on 77 & Halstead St. where Mac first met his sax man A. C. Reed who at the time needed a bass player. Mac was the right man for the job. He played with A. C. for only a short time when he got a chance to play with Muddy Waters. He was asked to come out to Big John’s Grill on the North side to sit in with the band. Muddy asked him where he was from, he replied Greenville, South Carolina. Muddy said, “son, if you’re from the South, then you can play,” and so he did for over a year. His first gig with Muddy was the Mother Blues Club. The band’s line up was Luther Johnson on guitar, Sammy Lawhorn on guitar, Frances Clay on drums, Otis Spann on piano, Mac Arnold on bass, and Muddy on guitar and vocals. The band would play most of the show and Muddy would play the end of the set. On occasions he would play every other set. This gave the guys a chance to show their stuff. Mac had an edge because he’d been working with James Brown in the past. A lot of people had yet to of heard of James Brown, so when Mac would play that funky stuff, it got a lot of people’s attention. Mac is a left handed bass player, and if you listen to some of his early recordings, you will hear he was way ahead of his time.\r\nThe band would tour from the East to West Coast and all points in between. Cruisin’ in a 1965 Fleetwood Cadillac, all 7 band members and the driver (Bo) at the wheel. Bo could drive almost non-stop from St. Louis to San Francisco with no sleep. One time they were passing through Mississippi, they stopped in to see some of Muddy’s relatives and wound up doing a show. Mac stayed at Muddy’s cousin’s house, and when L. A. he would stay with George Smith and his family of 6 kids. While touring the West Coast, Mac fell in love with the California weather. When he returned to Chicago he told his wife “we’re moving.”\r\n​\r\nMac talked to Muddy and told him he would give him time to find another bass player. Muddy wished him luck and said “he would have him back any time,” and that was it. Mac is one of the last surviving members of the Muddy Water’s era, and so Mac Arnold & Plate Full O’ Blues begins.\r\n​","url":"https://facebook.com/444554215902026","time":"19:00:00-0400","date":"2017-06-30"},{"venue":"Sunrift Adventures Inc.","venueUrl":"https://facebook.com/151960611506635","title":"Beginner's Whitewater Kayak Clinic","description":"New to Whitewater Kayaking?

We have pledged a portion of beverage sales to the organization's women and children's shelters across the Upstate.","url":"https://facebook.com/1703033153040979","time":"18:00:00-0400","date":"2017-06-02"},{"venue":"Smileys Acoustic Cafe","venueUrl":"http://www.smileysacousticcafe.com/calendar.php","title":"Charles Hedgepath","description":"Great Night of Music, with an array of players!\r\n","url":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=NWZ1Z29zMmd2MTRrbjhhcGtwbGJ0MHZicTRfMjAxNzA2MDZUMjIzMDAwWiBzbWlsZXlzYWNvdXN0aWNjYWZlQG0&ctz=America/New_York","time":"18:30:00","date":"2017-06-06"},{"venue":"Smileys Acoustic Cafe","venueUrl":"http://www.smileysacousticcafe.com/calendar.php","title":"Smiley's World Famous Open Mic!","url":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=dDRpa2dwZW1qNjZxZjBsMm1kbTY0b2Vuc2dfMjAxNzA2MDVUMjIwMDAwWiBzbWlsZXlzYWNvdXN0aWNjYWZlQG0&ctz=America/New_York","time":"18:00:00","date":"2017-06-05"},{"venue":"Smileys Acoustic Cafe","venueUrl":"http://www.smileysacousticcafe.com/calendar.php","title":"Live Band Karaoke","url":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=cWt2MGY0bGZqbmRrMjJiZDN1NDY4MWZmcjBfMjAxNzA2MDhUMDAwMDAwWiBzbWlsZXlzYWNvdXN0aWNjYWZlQG0&ctz=America/New_York","time":"20:00:00","date":"2017-06-07"},{"venue":"Smileys Acoustic Cafe","venueUrl":"http://www.smileysacousticcafe.com/calendar.php","title":"Eric Congdon","description":"Live Music","url":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=XzhkOWxjZ3JmZHByNmFzams2NHMzY2Roazc0cWowcDFpNmdxajhjcjQ3MHBtY2NwbjZjczM4ZHI2Y2dzajBjMWg3NWdnIHNtaWxleXNhY291c3RpY2NhZmVAbQ&ctz=America/New_York","time":"18:30:00","date":"2017-06-03"},{"venue":"Smileys Acoustic Cafe","venueUrl":"http://www.smileysacousticcafe.com/calendar.php","title":"Sezessionville Road","description":"Live Music","url":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=XzhkOWxjZ3JmZHByNmFzams2b3FqMHAxbjY1aDZjb2hsNzBxajRkaGhjZGo2OGMxbTcwbzMycGhvY29xNjhwMzRjOHNnIHNtaWxleXNhY291c3RpY2NhZmVAbQ&ctz=America/New_York","time":"18:30:00","date":"2017-06-02"},{"venue":"Smileys Acoustic Cafe","venueUrl":"http://www.smileysacousticcafe.com/calendar.php","title":"Sound Committee","description":"Live Music","url":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=XzhkOWxjZ3JmZHByNmFzams3NWg2OG9qNmNjcTY2ZDFtNjBxNjJvajI2cGgzNGUzMmNrcWo0ZGhvNzRwNmNjMW5jcGlnIHNtaWxleXNhY291c3RpY2NhZmVAbQ&ctz=America/New_York","time":"22:00:00","date":"2017-06-02"},{"venue":"Smileys Acoustic Cafe","venueUrl":"http://www.smileysacousticcafe.com/calendar.php","title":"Jonny Monster Band","description":"Live Music","url":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=XzhkOWxjZ3JmZHByNmFzamtjZGlqOHBobDZvcjMwb3BvYzhxajJwMWs2b3NtNm85Z2M1aTNjb2huY2hpNjhkcjY2b29nIHNtaWxleXNhY291c3RpY2NhZmVAbQ&ctz=America/New_York","time":"22:00:00","date":"2017-06-03"},{"venue":"Smileys Acoustic Cafe","venueUrl":"http://www.smileysacousticcafe.com/calendar.php","title":"The Hummingbirds","description":"Live Music","url":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=XzhkOWxjZ3JmZHByNmFzamtjZ3E2OGNqMmNrc2plZHBvNmRoM2lvcG5jaGdtYWUzM2M0cTNnbzltNmtvbWNwaGk2c3JnIHNtaWxleXNhY291c3RpY2NhZmVAbQ&ctz=America/New_York","time":"18:30:00","date":"2017-06-08"},{"venue":"Smileys Acoustic Cafe","venueUrl":"http://www.smileysacousticcafe.com/calendar.php","title":"Rockabilly Rogues","description":"Live Music","url":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=XzhkOWxjZ3JmZHByNmFzamtjcGozYWUxcGM4cTY0ZTlpY29vbTJkMXA2bGg2YWRqNGM0cWpnbzlrNnNwamVwYjY2MHFnIHNtaWxleXNhY291c3RpY2NhZmVAbQ&ctz=America/New_York","time":"22:00:00","date":"2017-06-08"},{"venue":"Smileys Acoustic Cafe","venueUrl":"http://www.smileysacousticcafe.com/calendar.php","title":"Kelly Jo & Buffaloe","description":"Live Music","url":"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=bnY0YnF2ZjMzZnVxaGxqZGFjMXEyMTA2dTggc21pbGV5c2Fjb3VzdGljY2FmZUBt&ctz=America/New_York","time":"21:30:00","date":"2017-06-06"}]
