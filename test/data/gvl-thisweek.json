    "title": "Gabe Dixon w/ Swamp Rabbit Railroad",
    "description":
      "Doors: 7pm\nShow: 8pm\n\n$12 adv. / $15 DOS\n\nThroughout Gabe Dixon's career, many other notable artists have taken note of his immense talents. He has held side gigs as keyboardist and vocalist for Paul McCartney, Alison Krauss & Union Station, O.A.R. and Supertramp. His songs have received placements on major television shows including Parks and Recreation, Grey's Anatomy, and Vampire Diaries, and his song \"Find My Way\" served as the title for the box office hit The Proposal starring Sandra Bullock. Fans have seen him perform twice on Jimmy Kimmel LIVE!, as well as The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and on festival stages everywhere from Bonnaroo to High Sierra Music Festival. However, it's with Turns To Gold that listeners will hear Gabe Dixon as he always meant.\n\n\"Turns To Gold\", released in April, 2016, was produced by Paul Moak (Mat Kearney, Third Day), engineered by Devin Vaughan (Marc Broussard), and mastered by Brad Blackwood at Euphonics Mastering (Allison Krauss & Union Station, Luther Dickinson). The LP marks Gabe's first official collection as an independent artist. Following the release of 2011's One Spark, the Nashville-based troubadour changed almost everything. He was focused on starting from scratch, and parted ways with his longtime management and record label, Concord Music Group. The one thing that didn't change was that honest, heartfelt approach to songwriting that countless fans fell in love with when he first emerged in 1999.\n\nTurns To Gold addresses some weighty subjects—mortality, what's important in life, and the value of love. \"In many ways, my new music is about learning how to be in a committed relationship, leave immature ways behind, grow, evolve, and move on from habits that aren't necessarily who you are anymore,\" he says. The album was recorded at The Smoakstack recording studio in Berry Hill, TN with Jano Rix on drums (The Wood Brothers), Viktor Krauss on bass (Lyle Lovett), and Kris Donegan on guitar (Cam). \"I wanted to go in with musicians and get performances that were inspiring and inspired, and take it from there. Producer Paul Moak was completely on the same page. We cut everything to analog tape with no click track. What results is an album that feels very natural. Since One Spark I learned to trust myself, and the sound of Turns To Gold is the most representative of who I am. It's warm, laid-back, acoustic, and live.\"\n\nThe opener and first single, \"Holding Her Freedom,\" out now, coasts between a shimmering piano melody, organ swell, guitar rumble, and heavenly vocal performance from Gabe. It also conveys a cinematic narrative. \"It's a story about a woman who has been burned by love, and she's afraid to let herself be vulnerable and fall in love again,\" he explains. \"She's figuratively holding her freedom like a cage. That same 'freedom' keeps her trapped and unable to love again.\" The album's second single, \"The Way To Love Me,\" features Natalie Prass and will be released on February 5th. \"Natalie's voice has the perfect delicate and vulnerable qualities that the song required,\" says Gabe. \"She recorded it while passing through Nashville to play the Ryman Auditorium, part of a long tour opening for Ryan Adams.\"\n\nhttp://www.gabedixon.com\n\n\n\nSwamp Rabbit Railroad represents the tradition of American folk revival music as established by Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Bob Dylan, among others, while also creating innovative and socially-pertinent tunes in the modern folk setting. Like folk songwriters of the past, this husband and wife duo seeks to be a voice for its generation. The Casons’ unique blend of harmonies creates a haunting and beautiful sound that captures the essence of the foothills in which they were formed while their onstage chemistry captivates the attention of any audience. \n\nhttp://swamprabbitrailroad.com",

    "description":
      "Horizon is once again asking Greenville to join us and pay it FORWARD for Food and Warmth on Small Business Saturday! Starting Saturday November 25th, Horizon Records will celebrate Small Business Saturday by encouraging all to share some Food (non-perishables only), or Warmth (need blankets, caps, gloves, socks) and of course deductible Cash or Check, all in support of TRIUNE MERCY CENTER, who bring desperately needed assistance to those in need in the season of Thanksgiving and all year round.\n\nTHE SWAG: We are giving away a ton of nifty, fun and sometimes collectible swag items we have accumulated as a music store in exchange for any donation to these 3 coffers. Freebies include, CD Samplers, Vinyl LP Test Pressings, Posters and more.\n\nTriune, with Pastor Deb Richardson-Moore at the helm, is on the frontline bringing spirituality and the services that so many hard-hit people need to get back on their feet or recover; the homeless, the hungry, the struggling addicts and others. Triune, just down 3 blocks from our corner provides a safe haven and a friendly respite day in day out for those who need it most, whether through food bank, classes or allowing a myriad of 12-step program meetings to use their rooms.\n\nHorizon Records, so grateful that we are able to still be on our corner (now celebrating 41 years), feels that all businesses are partners in our communities, and that sharing is the best way to show our thanks and in the process help others. SO we will have 2 big boxes set out and a donation jar in hopes that each of our customers, neighbors or just anyone wishing to pay it forward in this season of family, food and hearth.\n\nLast year your generosity created a whole pickup truck-load of stuff. Join us in this worthy Thanksgiving-season project and let's get 3 truckloads to transport over to Triune Mercy Center.",
